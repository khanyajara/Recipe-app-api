# Recipe API

This is a RESTful API for managing recipes, built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It allows users to create, read, update, delete, and list recipes with pagination. The API is structured with separate controllers, routes, and models, making it modular and maintainable.

## Features

- CRUD operations for recipes:
  - **POST** `/api/recipes` - Add a new recipe
  - **GET** `/api/recipes` - Retrieve all recipes with pagination
  - **GET** `/api/recipes/:id` - Retrieve a single recipe by ID
  - **PUT** `/api/recipes/:id` - Update a recipe by ID
  - **DELETE** `/api/recipes/:id` - Delete a recipe by ID
- Data validation and error handling
- Pagination support for large datasets

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime
- **Express** - Web framework for Node.js
- **MongoDB** - NoSQL database
- **Mongoose** - MongoDB ORM for modeling data
- **dotenv** - Environment variable management
